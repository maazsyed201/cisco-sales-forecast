# cisco-sales-forecast
This C program calculates a final forecast value by taking accuracy and bias inputs from three teams (Demand, Marketing, and Statistical ML) across three quarters. It identifies the top two teams based on weighted accuracy, evaluates their bias patterns, and computes the final forecast by adjusting or averaging their predictions accordingly 
Here’s a structured answer addressing your questions about the C-based forecasting project:

---

What the project does?

This project takes accuracy and bias data from three forecasting teams (Demand, Marketing, and Statistical/ML) over three quarters. It calculates weighted accuracy, identifies the two most reliable teams, evaluates the trend of their biases, and combines their forecasts to produce a more accurate and reliable final forecast.

Why the project is useful?

Forecast accuracy is critical in operations like supply chain, inventory management, and demand planning. This project helps businesses or analysts make better decisions by identifying which forecasting methods are most reliable and adjusting predictions accordingly based on bias trends. It’s a lightweight decision-support tool built in C.
